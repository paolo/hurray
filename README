Hurray!
Finally an easy way to develop mobile applications!

Requirements (so far):
Ruby  >= 1.8.7
JRuby >= 1.6 (to execute the simulator)

to run the helloworl test application:
go to the project's root (hurray folder)
ruby -Ilib/hurray-ruby-sdk helloworld.rb

to run the application, and view the results with the simulator:
go to the project's root.
jruby -Ilib/hurray-ruby-sdk -Itest/helloworld -Itools/hurray-jruby-sin simulator.rb

So far the hello world app is still not finished, using the simulator you'll only see an empty
window 640x480 (IPhone 3G resolution).
