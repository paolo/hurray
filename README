Hurray!
Finally an easy way to develop mobile applications!

Requirements (so far):
Ruby  >= 1.8.7
JRuby >= 1.6 (to execute the simulator)

to run the helloworld test application:
go to the project's root (hurray folder)
make run-ruby DIR=<file-parent-folder> RB=<file>

to run the application, and view the results with the simulator:
go to the project's root.
make run-sim DIR=<file-parent-folder> CL=<MainClassName>

Example:
to run the helloworld test application located at test/helloworld/helloworld.rb
make run-ruby DIR=test/helloworld RB=test/helloworld/helloworld.rb
mkae run-sim DIR=test/helloworld CL=HelloWorldController
